# Face Tracking for Creative Coding

A growing collection of examples used to demonstrate basic concepts of the usage of face tracking with creative coding on the modern web. This code has been collected and inited originally for Online Media Course (MOME), then it quickly became a basis for further workshops that are focusing on realtime interactions, creative animations and critical discussion on current technologies (think of face-id).

All the examples are using [P5JS](http://p5js.org/) for displaying graphics and playing back sounds. The face tracking is based on [clmtrackr](https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr). Each of these libraries can be found in the 'libs' folder. To launch the experiments, download the [brackets](http://brackets.io/) editor. Open the folder of this repository and hit 'live preview' on the top right.

### Folder Structure

Each example includes media files (sounds, animated gifs, images etc). The 'libs' folder contains the necessary js libraries and the pre-trained face traclking models.
